Overview
SmartBurger Ordering System is a menu‑driven Java console application that simulates a real fast‑food ordering experience.
It uses composition, input validation, and clean object‑oriented structure inspired by your SmartGym project.

Users can select burgers, toppings, side items, and drinks, with dynamic pricing based on size and product type.
The system calculates the total cost and ensures logical ordering flow (e.g., toppings and sides require a burger first).

Features
Menu‑driven console interface

Burger selection with fixed pricing

Toppings and side items (only available after choosing a burger)

Drink selection with size‑based pricing

Deluxe burger option

Input validation for all user choices

How It Works
The user selects a burger.

Once a burger is chosen, toppings and side items become available.

Drinks can be added at any time.

The system calculates the total price based on the selected items.

The user can exit the program at any time.
